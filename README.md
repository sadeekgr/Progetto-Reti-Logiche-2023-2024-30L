# Progetto Reti Logiche 2023/2024
The project was developed using Xilinx Vivado.

The digital timing diagram inside the report that explains the functioning of the program was made with WaveDrom (https://gburghoorn.com/wavedrom/#) and then edited, while all other graphical representations were made with Drawio (https://app.diagrams.net).

The python script is used to generate and test randomly generated sequences, it doesn't have any other uses and it wasn't part of the evaluation criteria, so it was quickly written and forgotten (as seen by the bad quality of the code).

All personal information, except the name, has been altered.
